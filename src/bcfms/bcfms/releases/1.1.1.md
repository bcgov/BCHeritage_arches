BCFMS 1.1.1 release notes
------------------------
Release to rework the IPA resource model

### Bug fixes and enhancements
- 1232: Rework the IPA resource model, add new LOV

### Dependency changes:
```
bcgov_arches_common:
1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
```

This release relaxes the upper bound on Django to add compatibility with further Django 4.2.x patch releases without requiring a corresponding Arches patch release.
### 1. BEFORE UPGRADING (!!! IMPORTANT !!!)
1. Update the maintenance page with appropriate dates and details. Maintenance page is found at `/sw_ux/httpd0(1|2)/www/html/maintenance.html`
2. Put system into maintenance mode:
```shell
touch /apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/maintenance/bcfms
```
3. Confirm system in maintenance mode by accessing:
   `https://(|dlvr|test)apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/bc-fossil-management`. System should not be live, and maintenance page should be displayed.
4. Backup database:
```shell
sudo -u wwwadm /bin/bash
cd /apps_ux/apps_[env]/backups/database
chmod 700 .
pg_dump -Upostgres bcfms_[env] > 2025-02-08_bcfms_pre_1.1.1.sql
gzip 2025-02-08_bcfms_pre_1.1.1.sql
chmod 400 2025-02-08_bcfms_pre_1.1.1.sql.gz
chmod 500 .
```

### 3. Perform deployment
1. The source code branches are as follows:
@todo - Need to update core repo to create version
```yaml
config_branch: "bcfms/release/1.1.1_rework_ipa"
private_branch: "main"
core_repo_tag: "v7.6.4.1_bcgov" 
common_repo_tag: "feat/add_rdm_functions"
```

2. The `migrations` variable must be set as follows (empty line ensure migrations are complete):
```yaml
perform_migration: True
migrate_as_superuser: True
migrations:
  - ""
```

3. Run the migration from the ansible-deployer docker image:
```shell
./run_playbook.sh arches-app.yml (dlvr|test|prod) bcfms
```

### 4. Take system out of maintenance mode:
```shell
sudo -uwwwadm rm /apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/maintenance/bcfms
```
