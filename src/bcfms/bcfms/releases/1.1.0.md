### Dependency changes:
```
Python:

    Upgraded:
        Arches 7.5.2 -> 7.6.4

Nodejs > 20.16.0
```

This release relaxes the upper bound on Django to add compatibility with further Django 4.2.x patch releases without requiring a corresponding Arches patch release.
### 1. BEFORE UPGRADING (!!! IMPORTANT !!!)
1. Update the maintenance page with appropriate dates and details. Maintenance page is found at `/sw_ux/httpd0(1|2)/www/html/maintenance.html`
2. Put system into maintenance mode:
```shell
touch /apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/maintenance/bcfms
```
3. Confirm system in maintenance mode by accessing:
   `https://(|dlvr|test)apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/bc-fossil-management`. System should not be live, and maintenance page should be displayed.
4. Backup database:
```shell
sudo -u wwwadm /bin/bash
cd /apps_ux/apps_[env]/backups/database
chmod 700 .
pg_dump -Upostgres bcfms_[env] > 2025-01-29_bcfms_pre_1.1.0.sql
gzip 2025-01-29_bcfms_pre_1.1.0.sql
chmod 400 2025-01-29_bcfms_pre_1.1.0.sql.gz
chmod 500 .
```

### 2. Update WSGI module in Apache (First deployment only)

To allow the deployment to complete cleanly, a 3.12 version of `mod_wsgi` needs to be deployed as follows:
```shell
sudo -uwwwadm /bin/bash
cd /apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/
python3.12 -mvenv venv_tmp_20241217
source venv_tmp_20241217/bin/activate
source ~/setup_proxy
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mod_wsgi
# Edit vhosts to set update wsgi library:
vi /sw_ux/httpd0(1|2)/conf.d/vhosts.conf
# Update the LoadModule to point to the new shared library:
LoadModule wsgi_module "/apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/venv_tmp_20241217/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/mod_wsgi-py312.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so"
# Save file and restart 
exit
sudo systemctl restart httpd0(1|2)
```

### 3. Perform deployment
1. The source code branches are as follows:
```yaml
config_branch: "bcfms/release/1.1.0"
private_branch: "main"
core_repo_tag: "v7.6.4.1_bcgov" 
common_repo_tag: "v1.0.0"
```

2. The `migrations` variable must be set as follows (empty line ensure migrations are complete):
```yaml
perform_migration: True
migrate_as_superuser: True
migrations:
  - "bcfms 1082_drop_materialized_views"
  - "models"
  - ""
```
3. Run the migration from the ansible-deployer docker image:
```shell
./run_playbook.sh arches-app.yml (dlvr|test|prod) bcfms
```

### 4. Set WSGI module in Apache to standard VENV and remove temp venv

To allow the deployment to complete cleanly, a 3.12 version of `mod_wsgi` needs to be deployed as follows:
```shell
sudo -uwwwadm /bin/bash
# Edit vhosts to set update wsgi library:
vi /sw_ux/httpd0(1|2)/conf.d/vhosts.conf
# Update the LoadModule to point to the standard shared library:
LoadModule wsgi_module "/apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/bcfms_(dlvr|test|prod)_venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/mod_wsgi-py312.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so"
# Save file and restart Apache service
exit
sudo systemctl restart httpd0(1|2)
sudo -uwwwadm /bin/bash
cd /apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/
rm -Rf venv_tmp_20241217
```

### 5. Reindex the database
After all migrations have been completed the database needs to be re-indexed to
pickup the geometry feature IDs.
```shell
sudo -uwwwadm /bin/bash
cd /apps_ux/apps_<env>
source bcfms_<env>_venv/bin/activate
cd bcfms
python manage.py bc_reindex_database
exit
```

### 6. Restart the apache server
```shell
sudo systemctl restart httpd0(1|2)
```

### 7. Rebuild the frontend assets and perform collectstatic
```shell
sudo -uwwwadm /bin/bash
cd /apps_ux/apps_<env>
source bcfms_<env>_venv/bin/activate
cd bcfms
source ~/setup_proxy
rm -Rf bcfms/staticfiles bcfms/media/build
python manage.py check
npm run build_development
python manage.py collectstatic
exit
```

### 9. Restart the apache server
```shell
sudo systemctl restart httpd0(1|2)
```

### 9. Restart the celery broker
The celery broker needs to be restarted to pickup the source code changes.
```shell
sudo -uwwwsvr /bin/bash
s6-svc -d /apps_ux/s6_services/bcfms_celery_<env>/
s6-svc -u /apps_ux/s6_services/bcfms_celery_<env>/
exit
```

### 10. Take system out of maintenance mode:
```shell
sudo -uwwwadm rm /apps_ux/apps_(dlvr|test|prod)/maintenance/bcfms
```
